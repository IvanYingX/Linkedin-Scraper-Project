*Flexibility for alternate EU Amazon offices*

Amazon’s mission is to be the most customer centric company in the world. The Workforce Staffing organization is on the front line of that mission by hiring the hourly fulfilment associates who make that mission a reality. To drive the necessary growth and continued scale of Amazon’s associate needs within a constrained employment environment, Amazon is creating a Workforce Staffing research program.

This program will re-invent how Amazon attracts, communicates with, and ultimately hires its hourly associates. This team will own multi-layered research and program implementation to drive deep learnings, process improvements, and strategic recommendations to global leadership. Are you passionate about data?

As a Manager, Data Science in Workforce Staffing, you will have a strong focus on quantitative data analysis, understanding labor markets and the candidates within them. You will be responsible for building and developing a team, developing roadmaps, and driving business impact through your research at global scale.

You will lead data science projects using your deep expertise in statistics (regressions, multilevel models, structural equation models, etc.), and data collection in a variety of settings (e.g., field studies, surveys, existing large data sets) to define and answer nebulous problems. You leverage your quantitative background to develop and test theoretical frameworks and design experiments. You design, deployment, and conduct analysis of our global candidate research activities, using experimental, quasi-experimental, and RCT methods. You relentlessly obsess over understanding our candidates and what attracts them to Amazon. You work with colleagues across Research, Data Science, Business Intelligence and related teams to enable Amazon find and hire the right candidates for the right roles at an unprecedented scale.

A customer-obsessed, relentless curiosity is a must, as is commitment to the highest standards of methodological rigor that a given study allows. This role provides opportunity for significant exposure to Amazon’s culture, leadership, and global businesses, and furthermore provides significant opportunity to influence how Workforce Staffing matches talent to business demand.

This will be a highly visible role across multiple key deliverables for our global organization. If you are passionate and curious about data, obsess over customers, love questioning the status quo, and want to make the world a better place, let’s chat. #scienceemea

Digital Product Manager (Data Science Products),London North Eastern Railway,"London, England, United Kingdom",Full-time,"Here at LNER, we are on a mission to set up a new in-house Machine Learning team to work on projects that truly demonstrate the business value of machine learning.

This in-house approach is a first for us, so we're on the hunt for a team of enthusiastic people who are up for the challenge of leading innovative data science projects.

The railway is a visible service used by millions, meaning your work will be impactful and have wide reaching implications. You will work within a new team of product managers, data scientists and machine learning engineers to deliver projects from start to finish - from ideation, to proof of concept, production, and maintenance/business as usual.

We do things differently here at LNER - we take a business-challenge led approach, meaning you will be working with a whole host of business areas to build machine learning models to meet their needs, alleviate pain points or generate revenue. You certainly won't get bored of the opportunities that come your way!

What will the Digital Product Manager (for Data Science Products) be involved in?

Reporting into the Product Manager Lead, this role will support LNER's vision to treat data across the business as an asset and an opportunity to achieve competitive advantage. This role is data-driven and is focused on enabling our data science journey to maximise predictive analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to deliver measurable business results.
You'll use your in-depth knowledge to develop a portfolio of machine learning opportunities by partnering with business areas, understanding their challenges, and helping them appreciate how machine learning could benefit them. You'll then be responsible for product managing these opportunities from ideation to proof of concept to production to ensure that machine learning scales or fails fast.

You'll also be involved in….

Scouting opportunities across the business for machine learning value, practicality, feasibility and business appetite.
Manage the product lifecycle of projects from proof of concept through to production and ongoing maintenance of algorithms, including proving business value through measurable results.
Promoting the importance of machine learning governance to build trust, transparency and a strong reputation for the use of machine learning to railway applications
Support the development of the data science strategy to direct LNER's data science capabilities and offer professional opinion and support on team development, project roadmapping and horizon scanning.
Implement the business engagement strategy to encourage a data driven culture and keep key stakeholders involved in the data science journey

As we strive to demonstrate the benefits of an in-house machine learning team, you'll need to thrive working in a fast-paced environment and be comfortable with a ‘test and learn' approach and not be afraid to experiment with creative solutions.

Does this sound like the ideal opportunity for you?

Of course, with this being such a specialised role, there are some ‘must haves' in terms of experience. You'll need to have experience in a similar role; as a team we are determined to show the business the true value of machine learning, so you'll need to hit the ground running.
You'll also need,
Prior experience and knowledge of product management is essential particularly in a digital/systems capacity
Experience taking products from idea generation through to product launch and ongoing maintenance
Highly numerate with strong and proven analytical skills to be able to commercially assess the value of opportunities within the pipeline
Experience of delivering data science proof of concepts and productionised models is advantageous
Sound understanding of data science and machine learning principles

Ultimately, we're looking for passionate people who will thrive on the challenge of demonstrating the value we can add as a Machine Learning team. These roles are initially for a period of 18 months, so you'll need to be able to quickly get up to speed with understanding our business challenges and be able to demonstrate effective solutions.

So, if you're ready for a new challenge and want to put your stamp on these new roles, what are you waiting for?
