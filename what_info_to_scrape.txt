Possible information to scrape:
    - Job title/position
    - Company name
    - Location
    - Salary 
    - Part time/Full time
    - Company size
    - Description 
    - Date posted
    - Closing Date
    - Interview Date
    - Benefits
    - Company logo?
    - Company sector

Issues found:
    - Some information is usually missing from job postings (especially salary)
    - A lot of companies dont follow the correct syntax for job postings on linkedin, leaving information out of the container where the information is meant to be, and instead 
      adding it all into paragraphs in the description (usually salary and benefits)
    - There isn't a commonly used layout for the description, each employer seems to put information in different orders and use different wording, for example
      sometimes they will say "requirements" and sometimes "qualifications required" or even "what we are looking for" etc.
    - Some job descriptions are very long and others barely contain any information, whilst some are very long with not much meaningful information inside

Proposed options:
    - Job title
    - Part time/full time
    - Location
    - Company name
    - Company size
    - Company sector
    - Featured benefits
